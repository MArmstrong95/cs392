## Homework 7
### Invert Image File

The purpose of this assignment is for you to learn Java's image manipulation abilities.

Write a Java program to read all the RGB values of an image, then write the inverted image to a new file.

The name of the input image file should be entered at the command line. The name of the output image file should be the
input file name preceded by `inv_`. For example, `java image1 source.jpg` would read `source.jpg` and create the file
`inv_source.jpg`.

Required error checking:
- be sure a source file is provided
- make sure the source file name ends in `.jpg`
